<h2>My makeup hobby</h2>




  
  <p>My name is Alena, I am 29 years old, married and have 3 daughters.
  I like cats and one day when my kids will be older I will get one. I enjoy traveling,
  but it's difficult with kids at this time. I like watching YouTube videos.
  Currently I am taking web design class. My hobby is makeup. I enjoy doing makeup
  and want to tell you more about my hobby.</p>

  <br>
  
  <p>I enjoy makeup because it is a whole world you can explore and learn something new every time.
  You can create beautiful looks for example Monica Belucci look, also I like makeup transformations.
  If you're asian woman and want to try new looks you can transform to european woman using makeup
  and no one will guess that you're asian. It's also possible to transform from young to old,
  and some prankers from YouTube videos I watch do this and create a lot of funny content!</p>

  <br>

  <p>If you like what I mentioned above and want to start doing makeup I have some tips for you.
  First things to do is watching video tutorials. You will understand which products exist for makeup.
  You will find out which products work better particularly for you.
  Then, repeat with your products what makeup artist shows you in the video.
  Practice as much as you can and you will be professional.
  I included some links you can use to develop your skills in makeup hobby:</p>
